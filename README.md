Description of website functionality

1) Where to start 

  You mostly start from the main page of the application. The main page is called
  an All. You need to click on the All category which is placed in the top left corner of the website. On the main page, you will see all products you can buy. Out-of-stack products are unavailable. You cannot buy them.

2) What consists of All category 

2.1) Navbar 

  On the top of the website, you have a navbar. The navbar can be divided into three containers. In the middle, you have a green logo of our page. This logo allows you to go back to the main page. 

  On the right of the screen, you have a money sign with an arrow. When you click on the arrow you can see the currencies. It is possible to choose the currency in which you prefer to pay or see the price of your products. You can open the list of currencies when you click on the arrow as well as you can close it by clicking event. There is an effect that lets the arrow rotate, so the position of the arrow changes when the dropdown of the currencies is displayed or not. 

  At the end of the right corner, we have a black cart icon. If you click on this icon you open a cart overlay. It shows you all products which you want to order. Most products have different attributes that can only be selected in PDP. In the cart overlay, you can easily change the number of products by clicking on the plus sign or the minus sign. The cart overlay tells you how many products are in the cart, then it shows you the product: name, brand, price, attributes, amount and the main photo. At the bottom, there are two buttons. One of them is a view bag which allows you to redirect to the cart page. The second one is a check out button. It does not work but if it would work, it could redirect you to the payment page. The view bag lets you see the cart items but on a separate page. You can close the cart overlay by clicking on the gray backdrop.

  If you do not have any products you cannot see a black circle with a number inside. The black circle is known as a badge. The badge is on the black cart icon.The number symbolizes how many products you have in your cart. (It is located on the top right corner of the page.)

  Do not forget that every page contains the navbar. No matter where you are on the page you can click without any doubt on any category you want to go back to All, Clothes or Tech. (It is located on the top left corner of the page.)

2.2) PLP - product listing page

  Under the navbar, you can see the name of the category where you are. It can be All, Clothes or Tech. Each category contains different products. The All category consists of the Tech category and the Clothes category. 

  Each product is on the card. The card can be observed when you mouse over the product which you want to buy. As soon as the card appears you will get from us the possibility to click on a green circle with a cart. If you click on the green circle with the cart you can observe that the number of your products in the black cart icon has been increased by adding a new product or updating the amount of an existing product. The main cart is located on the top right corner of the page in the navbar. Remember that when you click everywhere but inside your card border except for the green circle with the white cart. You will redirect to another website. It is called a product detail page (PDP). It is a webpage on an eCommerce website that provides information on a specific product.

  Each product box shows the product: image, brand, name and price.

3) PDP - product detail page

  As you click on the product box on the main page you will redirect to PDP. On the left side, you have a product gallery. When you click on it you get a chosen photo in the middle of the page. 

  On the right side of the webpage is located the product: name, brand, attributes, price, description, as well as the green add to cart button. If it is an out-of-stack product you cannot see any green add to cart button. Obviously, when you click on the green button the product is added to the cart. What is more important that you are allowed to add the same product with different attributes. Remember that you can only delete a product in the view cart  or in the cart overlay.

4) Cart

  The view cart is a more complex version of the cart overlay. How to find the cart overlay and the view cart ? You need to click on a black cart which is placed on the top right corner of the page and in it, you go down to the view bag. When you click on the view bag you will be on the view cart. Take into consideration that when you are on the cart page, you cannot click on the cart overlay and open it. 

  On the top left side of the page, you can see the name of the page, the list of the products, the tax value, the amount of the products, the total price without tax and the green order button. The list of the products contains the product: brand,  name, price and attributes. 
  
  On the right side of the website, we have the other elements which belong to the list of the products like photos of products, the single product amount and the plus sign and the minus sign that let you change the amount of the products or remove the product. The arrow signs on the photo allow you to change the active photo into a different one when you click on it.
 
  The order button could redirect you to the payment page if it was working.

Description of application functionality

1) Where to start 

You mostly start from the main page of the application. The main page is called an All category.  You need to click on the all category which is placed in the top left corner of the application. On the main page, you have all products you can buy. Out-of-stack products are unavailable. You cannot buy them. 

2) What consists of All category 

2.1) Navbar 

  On the top of the application, you have a navbar. The navbar can be divided into three containers. In the middle, you have a green logo of our page. This logo allows you also to go back to the main page. 

  On the right of the corner, you have a money sign with an arrow. When you click on the arrow you can see the currencies. It is possible to choose the currency in which you prefer to pay or see the price of your products. You can open the list of the currencies when you click on the arrow as well as you can close it by clicking event.  There is an effect that the arrow rotates so the position of the arrow changes when the dropdown of the currencies is displayed or not. 

  At the end of the right corner, we have a black cart.  If you click on the black cart you open a cart overlay. It shows you all products which you want to order. Most products have an attribute that can only be selected in PDP. In the cart overlay, you can easily change the number of products by clicking on the plus sign or the minus sign. The cart overlay tells you how many products are in the cart, then it shows you the product name, the product brand, the product price, the attributes of the products, the amount of the single product and the main photo of the product. At the bottom, there are two buttons.  One of them is the view back which allows you to redirect to the cart page. The second one is the check out. It does not work but if it would work, it could redirect you to the payment page. View back lets you see the cart overlay but on a separate web page. You can close the cart overlay by clicking on the gray background. 

  If you do not have any products you cannot see a black circle with a number inside. The black circle is known as a badge. The badge is on the black cart.  The number symbolizes how many products you have in your cart. (It is located on the top right corner of the page.)
  
  Do not forget that every page contains the navbar. No matter where you are on the page you can click without any doubt on any category you want to go back to All, Clothes or Tech.  (It is located on the top left corner of the page.)

2.2) PLP - product listing page

  Under the navbar, you can see the name of the category where you are. It can be All, Clothes or Tech. Each category contains different products. The All category consists of the tech category in the clothing category. 
Each product is on the card. The card can be observed when you mouse over the product which you want to buy.  As soon as the card appears you will get from us the possibility to click on a green circle with a cart. If you click on the green circle with a trolley you can observe that the number of your products in your main trolley was increased by adding and updating products. The main cart is located in the top right corner of the page in the navbar. Remember that when you click everywhere but inside your card border except for the green circle with the white trolley. You will redirect to another website. It is called a product detail page (PDP). It is a web page on an eCommerce website that provides information on a specific product.

  Each product box is shown an image of the product, the product brand, the product name and the product price. 

3) PDP - product detail page

  As you click on the product box on the main page you will redirect to PDP. On the left side, you have a product gallery. When you click on it you get a chosen photo in the middle of the page. 

  On the right side of the web page is located the product name, the product brand, the attributes of the product, the product price, the green button add to cart and the product description. If it is an out-of-stack product you cannot see any green button add to cart. Obviously, when you click on the green button the product is added to the cart. What is more important that you are allowed to add the same product with different attributes. Remember that you can only delete a product in the cart overlay.

4)  Cart

  Cart is the maximum version of the cart overlay. How to find cart overlay. You need to click on a black cart which is placed on the top right corner of the page and in it you go down to the view bag. Take into consideration that when you are on the cart page, you cannot click on the cart overlay and open it. 

  On the top left side of the page, you can see the name of the page, the list of the products, the tax value, the quality of the products, the total price without tax and the green button order. The list of the products contains the product brand, the product name, the product price and the attributes of the product. On the right side of the page we have the others elements which belong to the list of the products like photos of products, the single product amount and the plus sign and the minus sign that let you add or delete the same product. The arrow signs on the photo allow you to change the active photo into a different one when you click on it.
 
  The order button could redirect you to the payment page, if it was working.
